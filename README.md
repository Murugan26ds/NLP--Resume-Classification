Define the Problem: Clearly define the objective of the project. In this case, it could be classifying resumes into categories such as job titles, skill levels, or industries.

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of resumes that includes the text of the resumes and their corresponding categories. You can collect resumes from online job boards, professional networking sites, or use publicly available datasets.

Data Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Remove any unnecessary characters, symbols, or formatting from the resume text. Tokenization: Split the text into individual words or tokens. Stopword Removal: Eliminate common words that do not carry much meaning, such as "and", "the", etc. Lemmatization or Stemming: Reduce words to their base or root form to normalize the text. Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms. Common techniques include:

Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represent each document as a vector of word frequencies. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weight the importance of words in a document relative to their frequency in the entire corpus. Word Embeddings: Represent words as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning or deep learning models for classification. Some common choices include:

Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines (SVM) Random Forest Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) if using deep learning approaches. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model(s) on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Adjust hyperparameters and try different models if necessary.

Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to classify new resumes. This could be done through a web application, API, or integration into an existing system.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and retrain/update it as needed to maintain accuracy.

Documentation and Reporting: Document the entire process, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation results. Prepare a report summarizing the project and its outcomes.
